you can use mouse conrol to move the camera:
	-left click and drag to rotate the camera
	-middle click and drag to zoom the camera
	-right click and drag to pan the camera

all code written by me can be found in main.js in the js folder
this code requires it be in an internet location to run, due to the need to fetch the spline file
please feel free to view the code live in the website's debugger in chrome by pressing the 'F12' key to view the console and resources
